This Python application was deployed using Docker platform on Elastic Beanstalk, through a CI/CD Code Pipeline. 
The two files needed here are Dockerfile and Dockerrun.aws.json.
Dockerrun.aws.json is the AWS equivalent of a docker-compose.yml file.
If the source code is stored in docker hub, then you just need Dockerrun.aws.json file
